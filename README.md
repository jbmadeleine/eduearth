# eduearth
A friendly set of scripts to use the LMDz global climate model easily.
These scripts draw heavily from scripts developed originally by A. Spiga (see the companion Git 
project [eduplanet](https://github.com/aymeric-spiga/eduplanet) and the LMDz team (in particular F. Hourdin and E. Millour).

To download the model, install git and run this command:

git clone https://github.com/jbmadeleine/eduearth eduearth

To make sure you have everything you need on your computer, run:

./check_dependencies.sh

If that's the case, just install and run a first simulation:

cd eduearth

./install.sh

./run.sh

Enjoy !
