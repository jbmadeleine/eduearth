A friendly set of scripts to use the LMDz global climate model easily.
These scripts draw heavily from scripts developed originally by A. Spiga (see the companion Git 
project [eduplanet](https://github.com/aymeric-spiga/eduplanet) and the LMDz team (in particular F. Hourdin and E. Millour).
More help can be found on the wiki page: https://github.com/jbmadeleine/eduearth/wiki/EduEarth-user's-guide.
Enjoy !
